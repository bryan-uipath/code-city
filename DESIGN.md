# Codebase Visualizer — Design

A 3D "code city" built with Three.js, rendered in a retro-futuristic hologram style
(future-dark: deep navy, glowing cyan/violet, UiPath orange accents — same visual
family as the flow-presentation tool).

## Metaphor hierarchy

| Level | Metaphor | Rendering |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub org | Country | (future: multiple repo islands) |
| Repo / top-level folder (e.g. `packages/canvas`) | State / district | Large ground plate + big label |
| Folder | City block cluster | Nested ground plates, streets = padding gaps |
| File | City block | Raised plate containing buildings |
| Module (function/class/interface/...) | Building | Instanced box, style varies by kind |

## Semantics

- **Height / footprint** = lines of code (log-scaled height).
- **Module kind → building style**: class = tall tower (blue), function = box (cyan),
  component (React) = pink/magenta tower, interface = translucent violet "glass",
  type = flat slab (slate), enum = amber, const = short gray.
- **Churn overlay**: 12-month commit-touch count → gray → yellow → UiPath orange (#fa4616) → red heat.
- **Fix hotspots overlay**: same ramp but weighted by commits whose subject matches /fix|bug/i.
- **Focus / recent-diff overlay**: files changed in last 30 days glow green, everything else dims — "where is the action right now".
- **Coupling**: import edges file↔file, aggregated folder↔folder. Drawn as glowing bezier arcs when a node is selected; optional top-level package↔package arc overlay.
- **People layer**: open PRs from GitHub. Author avatar sprite hovers over the centroid of the files the PR touches, with a light beam down. **Draft PRs render orange wireframe scaffolding boxes** around affected file blocks (work under construction).

## Interaction

- Orbit / zoom / pan (OrbitControls).
- Hover → HUD tooltip (name, kind, loc, churn, fix count, PRs touching it).
- Double-click → camera fly-to + focus that node (breadcrumb updates). Esc / breadcrumb → back up.
- Mode buttons (HUD): Structure · Churn · Fix hotspots · Recent focus. Toggles: Coupling arcs · People/PRs.

## Data contract — `viewer/public/data.json`

Produced by `analyzer/analyze.mjs`. All ids are repo-relative POSIX paths.

```jsonc
{
  "repo": { "name": "flow-workbench", "root": "/abs/path", "analyzedAt": "ISO", "githubUrl": "https://github.com/UiPath/flow-workbench" },
  "tree": {                       // root folder node
    "type": "folder",             // 'folder' | 'file'
    "name": "packages",
    "path": "packages",           // == id
    "loc": 123456,                // sum of children
    "churn": 100, "fixChurn": 12, "recentChurn": 5,   // sums for folders
    "children": [ /* folder|file nodes */ ]
    // file nodes instead have:
    // "modules": [{ "name": "Foo", "kind": "class|function|component|interface|type|enum|const", "loc": 42, "exported": true }]
  },
  "edges": [ { "a": "packages/a/src/x.ts", "b": "packages/b/src/y.ts", "n": 3 } ],  // import coupling, deduped, n = import count
  "prs": [ { "number": 3055, "title": "...", "author": "someone", "avatarUrl": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/...", "isDraft": true, "updatedAt": "ISO", "files": ["packages/..."] } ]
}
```

Notes:
- `churn` = commits touching the file in last 12 months; `fixChurn` = subset with /\b(fix|bug)\b/i in subject; `recentChurn` = last 30 days.
- Edges only between files that both exist in the analyzed set. Workspace package imports (`@x/y`) resolve via packages' package.json names when possible.
- PR `files` filtered to files present in the tree.

## Style guide (hologram / future-dark)

- Background `#05080f`, exponential fog, faint cyan grid floor.
- Materials: emissive-heavy, slight transparency; additive-blended edge lines on focus; UnrealBloomPass for glow.
- HUD: monospace/uppercase, thin 1px cyan (#22d3ee) borders on translucent dark panels, orange (#fa4616) for active states. CSS scanline + vignette overlay for the retro-CRT feel.
